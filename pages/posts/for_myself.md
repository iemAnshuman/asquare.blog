I choosed coding because there was no point in being a physicist if I am not the best. I knew I am not in senior years of high school, so I decided to shift my focus to my second favourite subject: Computer Science. I liked coding things for fun and was doing good in college until recently. I always did CS for building fun projects but now I am in third year and I gotta do something serious for my career. I thought buidling more projects would be work which didn't. I realised that I need to go deep into a topic and learn it in depth, this was the most difficult thing because I loved everything in it, I loved crytography, I loved deployement, I loved CP, I loved building softwares, fixing kernels, configuring linux, just everything. I figured that AI would be really cool, mostly because it was unexplored and I had only a vague idea of what it is. So I learned about it and realised AI itself is very huge field and I have to be very specific about what I want to learn (for now), besides knowing the fundamentals of ML and DL. Up until now, I wasn't very sure but finally i have figured it out! I would love to work on intersection of Psychology, Cognition and AI. This might seem like expanding the scope but actually it's me being very specific.
