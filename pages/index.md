# Anshuman Agrawal

Hello, I'm Anshuman.

This is just my corner of the internet where I build things, break things, and sometimes accidentally make something cool.

Most of what you'll find here is work in progress. Notes I haven't edited yet. Code that might run or might explode. Ideas that aren't "case studies" or "products", they're more like snapshots of whatever I'm currently curious about.

I don't wait for perfect polish before putting things here.
Most of the fun is before polish.(to be truthful, I might not even put things here)

Some weeks I'm deep into a specific problem. Some weeks I'm just figuring out how to connect random concepts that don't look related at first. That exploration is the point. This space is less about "showcasing" and more about thinking out loud.

Expect messy prototypes.
Expect unfinished pages.
Expect projects that evolve in public.

I'm usually sleep deprived, caffeinated, and way too online but I like it this way.

Welcome to the workspace.
Chaos is not a bug here it's how progress starts.
