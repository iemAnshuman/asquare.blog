# Anshuman Agrawal

Hello! I'm **Anshuman**, and this is my personal space on the internet.

I'm a Computer Science student specializing in AI/ML, building my path toward research and creation at the intersection of machine learning, quantitative finance, and intelligent systems. My work ranges from reproducible ML projects and experimental research artifacts to writing, notes, and creative explorations.

This site is both a portfolio and a journal of my journey — a place where I share projects, thoughts, and the ideas I’m working through on my way to becoming a researcher and builder who contributes meaningfully to AI and beyond.
