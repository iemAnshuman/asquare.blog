# Anshuman Agrawal

I am a researcher and engineer focused on **High-Performance Computing (HPC)** and **Deep Learning Systems**.

While many focus on training larger models, I focus on making them run faster and leaner. My research bridges the gap between high-level AI frameworks and hardware reality, optimizing the "plumbing" of AI—from writing custom GPU kernels to analyzing distributed clusters.

I am currently an **Undergraduate Researcher** at the UPES AI Center, where I work on:

- **Kernel Optimization:** Writing custom **OpenAI Triton** kernels to fuse operations and optimize memory bandwidth, beating standard PyTorch eager execution.
- **Efficient Inference:** Implementing **4-bit Quantization (AWQ/GPTQ)** pipelines to deploy 7B+ parameter models on consumer-grade hardware.
- **Distributed Systems:** Analyzing **NCCL** communication primitives (Ring All-Reduce) to characterize bottlenecks in multi-node training.

### 🛠 Active Research

My work is open-source and documented in my primary engineering log:

- [**high-performance-deep-learning**](https://github.com/iemAnshuman/high-performance-deep-learning)
