# Anshuman Agrawal

I am a researcher and engineer interested in the efficiency of intelligence.

My work lies at the intersection of **High-Performance Computing (HPC)** and **Machine Learning**. I am currently investigating how to make large-scale foundation models accessible on edge hardware through quantization, sparsity, and distillation.

I believe that true understanding comes from building systems from scratch. This site serves as a **digital garden**—a collection of technical notes, research logs, and essays on the philosophy of mind and artificial cognition.

### Current Focus

- **Systems for AI:** Benchmarking Transformer inference on NVIDIA H100s.
- **Efficient ML:** Post-training quantization (INT8) and Knowledge Distillation.
- **Deep RL:** Stochastic processes in continuous control environments.

I don't just run code; I try to understand the _why_ behind the _how_.
